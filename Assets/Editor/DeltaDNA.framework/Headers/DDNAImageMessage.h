/**
 `DDNAImageMessage` draws an Engagement Image Message action on the screen.  Create one from a requested `DDNAEngagement`.  If the response from Engage contains an image message a 'DDNAImageMessage' is instantiated, otherwise nil is returned.
 
  ## Preparing the Image Message
 
  The `DDNAImageMessage` must download it's resources such as the background image separately.  Use the `DDNAImageMessageDelegate` to be notified once the resources have been downloaded.
 
  ## Showing the Image Message
 
  Use `-isReady` to check the resources have been successfully downloaded.  If ready `-showFromRootViewController:` will draw the image message on top by adding it to the View Controller's hierarchy.
 
  ## Actions
 
  Each Image Message supports actions that are defined when setting up the Image Message on the platform.  The `DDNAImageMessageDelegate` calls `-onDismissImageMessage:name` for dismiss actions.  Other actions call `-inActionImageMessage:name:type:value`.  Use this callback to handle custom commands from the engagement.
